# Ten-Ball Pool

**UCLA CS 174A, Winter 2020**

Team Members: Tejas Bhat, Danni Chen, William Chern, Edward Lu

## Game Setup and Rules
This is an implementation of 10-ball pool using tinygraphics. However, we put our own spin on the game in order to make it more entertaining and unique. The balls are set up exactly the same way as in standard 10-ball pool. However, the user cannot simply select the angle and power to shoot at. Instead, the power is set to high automatically and there is a spinning arrow that the user must use and time perfectly in order to get the angle that he or she wants. 

The goal of the game is to get in as many of the ten balls in as possible without regard for the order that they are shot in. Each time the user gets a ball in, he or she is awarded 10 points. If the user gets the cue ball in, he or she loses 10 points. If the user's score ever goes negative, then the game is over. If the user scores all the balls in, then he or she wins!

### Skybox

We created a skybox in order to create the background of a real casino. In order to do this, we  

### Texture Mapping

There were a lot of different textures that we had to map throughout this entire project in order to make the 10-ball pool simulation better.
- Cue Ball:
- Strike Balls:
- Table Felt:
- Table Wood Finish: 

### Lighting

In terms of lighting, we wanted to create several different tyeps of experiences for the user.
