## Game Setup and Rules
This is an implementation of 10-ball pool using tinygraphics. The balls are set up exactly the same way as in standard 10-ball pool. The player selects the angle for the pool stick and a specific power. This game mimics a popular 'practice mode' in 10 ball pool, in which one player tries to 'run the rack,' or clear every ball on the table without scratching.

The goal of the game is to get in as many of the ten balls in as possible without regard for the order in which they are shot. The player loses the game if the cue ball is potted, and the game can be reset. The player wins if all the number balls are potted!

## Features

### Physics Simulation

This section of the readme will go over the physics implementation. The explanation for the physics implementation will be split into five parts: Part 1 will give a brief overview of the PhysicsObject API we made to represent a simple physics object, Part 2 will go into the two representations of a PhysicsObject's force vector used, Part 3 will go into basic collision calculations ignoring glancing collisions, Part 4 will go over glancing collision calculations, part 5 will go over ball rolling, part 6 will go over hole collision detection, and Part 7 will go over general challenges in the Physics implementation.

1) PhysicsObject API - 
	We created a PhysicsObject API to encapsulate the complexity of representing a physics object. The PhysicsObject API is contained in physics.js. In this documentation, we will only briefly go over the constructor of the object; other calculations in the PhysicsObject API like glancing collisions are explained in later sections.The constructor for the PhysicsObject contains the `damping_constant`, `mass`, `center_transform`, `radius`, `time_constant`, `object_tag`, and `initial_transform` parameters. A brief explanation of each is given below.
	* `damping_constant`: This controls how much friction acts on the object over time, slowing it down.
	* `mass`: This is the mass of the object, and is used in physics based calculations to properly calculated transfer of energy between objects.
	* `center_transform`: This is the initial transform of the center of the object.
	* `radius`: This is the radius of the object (the PhysicsObject calculations assume a spherical or circular object for simplicity).
	* `time_constant`: This is the current speed at which physics calculations are done; a lower time_constant will mean a "slow-motion" effect.
	* `object_tag`: This is a string passed into to uniquely identify the object for debugging purposes.
	* `initial_transform`: This is an initial offset transform from the object's center.
	
2) Representation of objects' force vectors - 
	One nontrivial piece of work was in deciding how to represent the force vector acting on a PhysicsObject. Since our game is based on billiards, it is convenient to have a force vector represented as two angles (one angle offset from the zx axis, another angle offset from the zy axis) and a magnitude, which makes the launching of the ball easy. However, it is also convenient to have a force vector represented as three x, y, and z magnitude components. Both of these representations are used within PhysicsObject, and converted to and from each other depending on which format is more convenient for calculation. For example, for basic collision calculations, an x-y-z format of force vectors are used since the collision calculation becomes basic vector addition. On the other hand, when applying force to an object, we used the two angle offsets and magnitude representation, to make it easier to apply force to the cue ball based on the user input.
	You can find the code for converting between these two representations in the `calculate_x_y_z` and `calculate_offset_angles_and_magnitude` functions of the PhysicsObject.

3) Basic collision calculations - 
	This section will go over basic collision calculation. The function of PhysicsObject responsible for this calculation is the `calculate_elastic_collision` function. 
	The equations we used for calculating elastic collision between objects were standard (see Elastic Collisions Formula in references). We simply did a 1D elastic collision calculation for all three components of two colliding objects' force vectors. However, this calculation does not take glancing collision into account (i.e., when objects do not collide in a perfectly straight line). We go over adjustments we made to account for glancing collisions in the next section.
	Also note that in the actual demoed implementation, when calculating the magnitudes of the force vectors on objects after colliding, we did not use a physically accurate equation, and instead approximated the magnitudes of the post-collision forces (see the calculate_elastic_collision_2d formula in the PhysicsObject API). We did this because we were having trouble implementing the real physics equations, and so we approximated something that looked reasonable for most cases.

4) Glancing collision calculations - 
	In order to make collisions look more realistic, we implemented glancing collision logic. This involved finding the angles at which objects collided, and making sure that the objects' post collision trajectories properly reflected this initial angle of collision.
	We found in attempting to implement glancing collisions that there are actually two types of glancing collisions, the logic for both of which we will go over separately.
	Before going into the two types of glancing collisions and their necessary calculations, it is good to clear out some general terminology first. We define the collision normal as the vector which goes through both of the objects' centers (it is important to note that we are only dealing with basic spherical and circular collisions in 2D, which allows us to make this simplification). We define the separation vector as the vector perpendicular to the collision normal. We define the pre-collision trajectory as the force vectors of the objects before they undergo collision and transfer energy. We define the post-collision trajectory as the force vectors of the objects after they undergo collision and exchange energy.
	With the basic terminology out of the way, we can go over the two types of glancing collisions.
	The first type of glancing collision is one in which both of the initial force vectors of the two objects colliding are on opposite sides of the separation vector. In order to properly calculate post-collision trajectories of objects for this type of glancing collision, one can simply reflect the initial force vectors of both objects across the collision normal, and this gives reasonable looking results. Below we give a picture to demonstrate this type of collision in our simulation. The red, green, and blue vectors are the collision normal, pre-collision trajectory, and post-collision trajectory of the first object, respectively. The yellow, teal, and violet vectors are the collision normal, pre-collision trajectory, and post-collision trajectory of the second object, respectively. Note that the only difference between the first and second object's collision normals is their direction.

	The second type of glancing collision is one in which both of the initial force vectors of the two objects colliding are on the same side of the separation vector. In order to detect this case, we used something akin to the implicit formula of the separation vector and checked the initial force vectors (see the `is_right` function of PhysicsObject).  For this case, it is necessary to decide which object is "behind" the other object; the object which is "behind" can be reflected using the same logic as the first type of glancing collision, but the object which is "in front" cannot, otherwise it will be reflected backward. In our current implementation, we simply do not adjust the angle of the "in front" object, but there is likely a more physically correct way to handle it. However, we chose to keep the implementation simpler, as this way of doing things gives reasonable looking results. In order to decide which object is "behind" the other, we first see what side of the collision normal the force vectors are on, and then see which side of the separation vectors the centers of the two colliding objects are on. This is enough information to determine which object is "behind" and calculate final trajectories accordingly. Below we give an example of this type of collision in our simulation. The meaning of the colors of collision markers is the same as in the first image we showed. Note that only the collision markers for the "behind" object are shown.

5) Ball rolling - 
	The ball rolling was implemented using the velocity vectors of the balls' physics objects to determine the distance that they travelled in a time step, and then using the balls' radii to calculate the proper angle to rotate the balls by. The general relationship used is that the ball's circumference is given by (2)(PI)(radius), and so the angle in radians, x, to rotate the ball if it travelled a distance d is given by the following equation:
	
	x / (2(PI)) = d / (2(PI)(radius))
	
	The only other issue is deciding the axis to roll the ball on; we do this by simply checking the direction in which the ball is currently rolling using its velocity vector, and then taking the vector perpendicular to that in order to get the axis of rotation.
	
6) Hole Implementation - 

	In order to implement the holes, we implemented a limited amount of vertical physics, in that we added an option to enable gravity to the PhysicsObject API. For the holes, we simply detect when a ball is over a hole, and if it is, we enable gravity on the ball to make it look like it is falling into the hole.

	One of the problems we ran into while implementing this is that the balls would sometimes move too quickly while falling "into" the hole and look as if they were falling through the table. In order to fix this, we had to implement some hole "catching" logic, so that a ball didn't leave the bounds of a hole after it had been detected as falling into the hole. To do this, we added extra logic to the hole collision detection so that once a ball was "caught" by a hole, there would be the necessary logic to keep the ball from leaving the bounds of the hole. We did this by moving the ball back along its current direction of motion whenever it left the bounds of the hole it was captured by. 

	We also re-used our physics elastic collision in a different way here to give the illusion of the ball rolling around in the hole. We noticed before we had fixed the physics collision to avoid it that sometimes balls would curve into each other after a collision and spin around. We realized this happened whenever the physics collision calculation happened too late, when the balls that collided were already inside one another. We used this fact to create the illusion of the ball spinning around in the hole by having the balls that fall into holes collide with a fake ball placed on the hole, so that it looks like the ball is spinning around the hole. Even though this is a hack, it still gives a reasonable illusion of circular motion after a ball has entered a hole.

7) General challenges in the Physics implementation - 
	Although the physics implementation is relatively trivial (it all occurs within a 2D plane which simplifies things significantly), it was still fairly challenging to get the implementation working to the degree that it currently is, and it is still not perfect by any stretch. The main challenges were:
	1) Ensuring that angular calculations were carried out correctly. Initially, many calculations were seemingly unpredictable and hard to work with; this was solved by doing more strict cleaning of inputs (i.e. ensuring input angles were always positive and in between 0 and 2pi radians).
	2) Another major challenge to get the physics to work correctly is the unpredictability of when physical calculations will be done in time; at many points of our simulation, physics calculations are done too late in time which leads to undesirable results (i.e., a ball to ball collision will be detected when the balls are already too far inside each other, which leads to unexpected behavior). We solved this through various fixes such as re-adjusting the positions of balls during collision to reasonable positions if they were too far inside each other, and forcing the centers of balls to be within the playing area during every update, and this leads to some undesirable visuals. For example, when balls bounce against each other, you may notice a "snap" as they are moved into a more appropriate place, since their collision was detected when they were already too far within each other. However, without this position readjustment fix, balls that collide will often curve into each other unrealistically. There are many improvements that could be made to make the physics look more realistic and perform better, but given our time constraints we believe the physics simulation we achieved was reasonable.

### Collision Detection

 * In order to detect collisions, we gave each object a center and radius, and we detect two objects that collide with each other whenever the distance between the center of two objects is less than or equal to the sum of their radii.

### Skybox

We created a skybox in order to create the background of a real casino. In order to do this, we create a `square_map` which is a wrapper of cubic object and "stick" images inside the cubic to simnulate a skybox, our skybox only attach images to 4 sides (top and bottom are not mapped because we want to put our camera futher away from the scene).

### Texture Mapping

There were a lot of different textures that we had to map throughout this entire project in order to make the 10-ball pool simulation better. Some of the textures were flat, like the table felt and wood. However, others had to be optimized for spherical shapes, especially the cue ball and number balls. 
- Cue Ball
- Number Balls
- Table Felt
- Table Wood Finish

## Shadows

We implemented shadows using a two-pass rendering technique and a custom shadow shader. We first drew all the balls and calculated the shadow map using the ball's relative position with regard to the overhead lighting. Then, on the second pass, we drew the pool table's green felt using the shadow textures and overlaid the rest of the environment as well. Since graphic rendering times were too slow on our machines when utilizing the best shadow technique, we opted for lower resolution shadows.

## Reflections

We implemented reflections very similarly to shadows. Instead of using a shadow shader, however, we used a reflection shader. We created this reflection shader by utilizing the fragment code of a Phong Shader and combining that with the existing Shadow Shader code.
 
We used a two-pass rendering technique here as well. We first drew all the balls and calculated the reflection map using the ball's relative position with regard to the overhead lighting. Then, on the second pass, we drew the pool table's glass utilizing the reflection textures and overlaid the rest of the environment as well. Since graphic rendering times were too slow on our machines when utilizing the best reflection technique, we opted for lower resolution reflections.

### Lighting

In terms of lighting, we wanted to create several different types of experiences for the user. While the original light setting is set to more of a family pool table with regular dark shadows, the 'party mode' makes the pool table seem like it is in a club with overhead lighting on the balls. In this way, the environment is dynamic and can be changed to the user's wishes. 

We implemented the 'party mode' by dimming the texture objects, changing the location of the main light source, and creating the simulation of a glass table using reflections. All the balls, utilizing the Phong Shader, are affected by this change.
